<h1>10 Tips to Boost Your Android Phone's Battery Life</h1>
<p>There are a number of factors that contribute to poor battery life on your&nbsp;<a
        href="https://www.pcmag.com/picks/the-best-android-phones">Android phone</a>. Thinner bodies, brighter screens,
    faster processors, more background software, and speedier internet connections all take their toll on phone
    batteries, but manufacturers are also incorporating more powerful batteries to compensate.</p>
<p>Most new flagship phones offer all-day battery. The <a href="https://www.pcmag.com/reviews/google-pixel-7-pro">Google
    Pixel 7 Pro's</a> 5,000mAh battery provided just under 11 hours of juice in our tests, while the <a
        href="https://www.pcmag.com/reviews/samsung-galaxy-s22-ultra">Samsung Galaxy S22 Ultra</a> ran for a bit over 12
    hours. Still, there are ways to get more out of any phone.</p>
<p>Menu settings will differ based on which phone you're using and what operating system version you have; in this
    story, we used a <a href="https://www.pcmag.com/reviews/samsung-galaxy-s20-fe-5g">Samsung Galaxy S20 FE</a> running
    <a href="https://www.pcmag.com/reviews/google-android-11">Android 11</a>. But all Android devices should have
    similar features. With this caveat in mind, here are some ways to improve the battery life on your Android phone.
</p>

<h2>1. Turn On Power Saving Mode</h2>

<p>Think you're going to be stuck in a situation where you need your phone battery to last longer than it normally does?
    Switch your phone into power saving mode, which automatically cuts back on functions that may eat battery life. On
    our Samsung device, we opened <strong>Settings &gt; Battery and device care</strong>, then tapped the <strong>Battery</strong>
    entry.</p>
<p>Below the battery usage chart, we enabled <strong>Power saving mode</strong> to immediately limit networking,
    syncing, and location services, and turn down the screen's refresh rate. By tapping <strong>Power saving
        mode</strong>, we could further customize the feature by turning off the Always on Display, limiting CPU speed
    to 70%, or decreasing brightness by 10% in order to save even more battery life. There is also a Power Saving option
    in the Quick Settings menu.</p>
<p>For maximum power-saving, the <strong>Limit apps and Home screen</strong> option enables only selected apps and
    limits all background activity when power saving mode is turned on. For older versions of Android, you may be
    offered multiple power saving mode presets, each with a different balance between performance and battery life.</p>
<p>If you're on a Google Pixel, you can set similar battery limits under <strong>Settings &gt; Battery &gt; Battery
    Saver</strong>. There are also options to schedule when Battery Saver turns on and enable <strong>Extreme Battery
    Saver</strong> to get even more battery life.</p>

<h2>2. Adjust Screen Brightness</h2>

<p>Smartphone screens are big, bright battery hogs. You probably don't need your device turned up to the brightest
    setting. Go into your Display settings and turn down the brightness on the screen. You can also open the pull-down
    screen and control the brightness from there.</p>
<p>While you're at it, consider disabling auto brightness. This feature adjusts based on your perceived needs but can
    also raise the brightness of your display higher than it needs to be. Turn off the switch next to <strong>Adaptive
        brightness</strong> and your eyes (and battery) will thank you.</p>
<hr>
<h2>3. Manage Your Lock Screen</h2>
<p>Always on Display may be a <a href="https://www.pcmag.com/reviews/apple-iphone-14-pro">brand new feature</a> for
    iPhone users, but it's been available on Android devices for quite some time. This allows basic information, such as
    the time and date, to be visible on the screen when the display is otherwise turned off. The feature is meant to use
    as little energy as possible, but you can set limits to squeeze out every drop of power.</p>
<p>If you own a Samsung Galaxy device, head to <strong>Settings &gt; Lock screen</strong> and disable the switch next to
    Always on Display. You can also tap <strong>Always on Display</strong> to set it to only display when the screen is
    tapped or just at certain times if you don't want to lose the feature completely. Most Pixel phones allow you to
    make changes under <strong>Display &gt; Lock screen</strong> &gt; <strong>Always show time and&nbsp;info</strong>.
</p>
<hr>
<h2>4. Set When Your Screen Times Out</h2>
<p>The longer your phone's screen stays on, the more battery life you use up. You can counter this by setting the screen
    to turn off sooner than it might normally. If you tend to abandon your unlocked phone on the table, this is the
    feature to change. On both Galaxy and Pixel phones, you can open <strong>Settings &gt; Display &gt; Screen
        timeout</strong>, and then select among a number of options, from 15 seconds to 10 minutes.</p>
<hr>
<h2>5. Turn Off Location and Wireless Services</h2>
<p>Even when it's sitting idle, there are all sorts of signals being sent from your phone that can ultimately drain your
    phone's battery (even if it happens only a little bit at a time). If you want the maximum amount of power you can
    get, there are a few backend services you can turn off if you don't want to go full Power Saving mode.</p>
<p>Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and mobile data use up battery life with each new ping you receive. An easy way to conserve some
    battery is to open the pull-down shade on your phone and tap the Airplane mode button. This will instantly
    disconnect your phone from all these services and save some juice.</p>
<p>Location services may let you navigate with <a href="https://www.pcmag.com/reviews/google-maps">Google Maps</a>, but
    all those GPS pings that happen in the background can wear down a battery quick. You can turn off location services
    completely from <strong>Settings &gt; Location</strong> to <a
            href="https://www.pcmag.com/how-to/how-to-get-google-to-quit-tracking-you">stop Google from tracking you</a>.
    However, this will stop a number of apps from working properly. Instead, you can select <strong>App
        permissions</strong> to revoke access to only specific apps that may be particularly bad about pinging your
    phone.</p>
<hr>
<h2>6. Turn Off Background App Refresh and Updates</h2>
<p>Apps continue to run in the background even when you aren't using them. This will, of course, eat up data and battery
    life over time. You can put unused apps to sleep under <strong>Battery</strong> settings on your Samsung device.
    Choose <strong>Background usage limits</strong> and enable <strong>Put unused apps to sleep</strong> to prevent apps
    from wasting your battery life.</p>
<p>You can go a step further and manually tell your phone to put certain apps to sleep. Select <strong>Sleeping
    apps</strong> or <strong>Deep sleeping apps</strong>, then tap the plus <strong>(+)</strong> icon and add your app
    to the list. Keep in mind that sleeping apps will only receive updates occasionally and deep sleeping apps will not
    work unless they are in use, so updates may be delayed.</p>
<p>It's a good idea to periodically check on the apps that are draining your battery. Go to <strong>Battery and device
    care &gt; Battery &gt; View details</strong>, then decide which apps should be allowed to run in the background and
    which should be turned off when not in use.</p>
<p>On Google Pixel phones, open <strong>Battery &gt; Adaptive preferences</strong> and turn on <strong>Adaptive
    Battery</strong> so apps you don't use much will work less in the background. You can also control individual apps
    from <strong>Apps &gt; See all apps &gt; Battery</strong>, then make sure the app is set to Optimized.</p>
<hr>
<h2>7. Disable Active Listening</h2>
<p>If you activate your voice assistant with a wake word, your device will be on alert for that word, using up battery
    life while it waits. Whether it's Google Assistant or Samsung's Bixby, you can turn this feature off and save a
    little extra juice.</p>
<h3>Recommended by Our Editors</h3>
<p>Many Android phones have Assistant embedded into the OS, so hold down the home button to call up the feature and tap
    the inbox icon. Otherwise, open the app. Tap your profile image and open <strong>Hey Google & Voice Match</strong>,
    then disable <strong>Hey Google</strong> if it's turned on.</p>
<p>If you're constantly bumping into issues with Bixby, turn the whole thing off. Here are detailed instructions on <a
        href="https://www.pcmag.com/how-to/how-to-disable-bixby-on-your-samsung-phone">how to disable Bixby</a> on your
    phone.</p>

<h2>8. Dumb Down Your Phone</h2>
<p>Modern smartphones are like small supercomputers that fit in your hand, but you don't really need the processor
    running at full speed all the time if you're just searching the web. A feature called Enhanced processing allows you
    to decide whether you want faster data processing or longer battery life.</p>
<p>To change this setting on your Samsung device, go to <strong>Battery and device care &gt; Battery &gt; More battery
    settings</strong> and make sure <strong>Enhanced processing</strong> is disabled.</p>
<p>Another item to take control of is the refresh rate of your screen. Turning this up higher can help make animations
    on the screen look smoother, but it's not necessary and it uses more battery than normal. Open
    <strong>Display</strong> settings and find <strong>Motion smoothness</strong>, then make sure you're set to the
    standard 60Hz screen refresh rate instead of the enhanced 120Hz or higher.</p>
<hr>
<h2>9. Automate the Process</h2>
<p>If this seems like too much to manage manually, you can always set up a few automatic functions to help your battery.
    Open <strong>Battery and device care &gt; Battery &gt; More battery settings</strong> and turn on <strong>Adaptive
        battery</strong>. This will let your phone learn your charging habits in order to conserve battery life until
    the next charge.</p>
<p>You can also use Google Assistant and turn phone settings into programmable routines. Open Google Assistant, tap your
    profile icon, and select&nbsp;<strong>Routines&nbsp;</strong>to create new commands. Select a routine (or
    tap&nbsp;<strong>+</strong>&nbsp;to create a new one) then tap&nbsp;<strong>Add action</strong>. While there are
    many preset actions, for our purposes, select&nbsp;<strong>Try adding your own</strong>&nbsp;at the bottom of the
    list.</p>
<p>For example, you could set it up so that the phone will prompt you to turn on power saving mode when you tell Google
    you're leaving the house or turn on Airplane Mode when you're home. Basically, if it's a command you can give Google
    Assistant, you can turn it into a routine.</p>
